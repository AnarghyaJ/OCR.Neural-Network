1.separate the pixels into two clusters according to the threshold
2.find the mean of each cluster
3.square the difference between the means
4.multiply by the number of pixels in one cluster times the number in the other

If we incorporate the math from the previous section we get:

compute histogram and probabilities of each intensity level
set up initial q_i(0) and \mu_i(0)
step through all possible threshold maximum intensity
update q_i and \mu_i
compute \sigma_b^2(t)
desired threshold corresponds to the maximum
